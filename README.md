# finalProject
I added more powerups to the game such as: 
-a jetpack to give the power unlimited jumps for a limited time
-a laser that follows your mouse and kills mobs when you hit them. A bunch of mobs start to spawn once you get the powerup. There are also sound effects when you get the laser and when you kill a mob.
-you can shoot carrotts when you hit X that will kill mobs
I also increased the width of the screen and made the platform themes change as your score increases.
I didn't get to creating moving platforms but I did accomplish my main focus which was getting the laser power up working. 
Joe helped me a lot on creating the laser powerup.
I also added cati that decrease your score by 10 if you hit them.
