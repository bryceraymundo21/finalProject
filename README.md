# finalProject
**********Gameplay ideas:
*means its done or close to being done
*Jump on enemy head to create jump boost using power up code
Platforms move back and forth-Did not get to this feature
Add a death screen-Did not get to this feature
*Increase screen size
*Change the platform theme based on score
*Shoot carrots using x to kill enemies  

**********Bugs
when you get launched by powerup or head jump player sometimes snaps to platform abruptly 
happens when hitting jump during power up boost
*the double jump lasts forever instead of 10 seconds

**********Gameplay fixes
Platform randomness leaves player in limbo for extended periods
Lower spawn location so player can get out of random stuck situations
 

**********Features
*Varied powerups
*Double jump
*Shooting laser beams to destroy enemies
*Roblox oof sound plays when you kill an enemy
*Equip sound for laser

I added more powerups to the game such as: 
-a jetpack to give the power unlimited jumps for a limited time
-a laser that follows your mouse and kills mobs when you hit them. A bunch of mobs start to spawn once you get the powerup. There are also sound effects when you get the laser and when you kill a mob.
-you can shoot carrotts when you hit X that will kill mobs
I also increased the width of the screen and made the platform themes change as your score increases.
I didn't get to creating moving platforms but I did accomplish my main focus which was getting the laser power up working. 
Joe helped me a lot on creating the laser powerup.
I also added cati that decrease your score by 10 if you hit them.
